# 🏥 HealthFlow AI - Medical Recovery Intelligence System

AI-powered adaptive fitness and nutrition for post-surgical patients and chronic disease management.

## 🎯 Problem
60% of post-surgical patients re-injure themselves. Existing fitness apps can't read medical restrictions, monitor recovery biomarkers, or prevent medication-food interactions.

## 🚀 Solution
Multi-agent AI system that:
- Reads medical documents and extracts constraints
- Monitors HRV/biometrics for recovery state
- Generates medically-safe, adaptive workouts
- Checks meals for medication interactions
- Logs all decisions to Opik for evaluation

## 🏗️ Architecture
```
Medical Parser Agent → Extracts constraints
         ↓
HRV Monitor Agent → Assesses recovery capacity
         ↓
Nutrition Advisor → Checks meal safety
         ↓
Workout Orchestrator → Generates adaptive plan
         ↓
Opik → Tracks decisions & outcomes
```
